# data-sourcing-challenge
In this assignment we used APIs keys from The New York Times and The Movie Database. Python was used in this assignment to build the code. In this assignment I learned how create a developer profile to create API keys. This assignment was the most challenging by far. I had to use two tutoring sessions and course resources to complete it. It was in this assignment that I inadvertently learned that Github is very specific in how the program wants data to be cloned. I had to delete my repositiory several times because I could not push my data. It has been extremely frustating at say the least.
